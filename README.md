# Our Project

This project is basically for creating a small program to interface with a CMOD S6 just using command line and the Adept 2 SDK. I'll be adding on more soon but here is a little bit more about how to install below


In this project, I tried to orignally use a Visual Studio project, which kinda sucks... So I'll be going to Minigw for Windows.

Just for reference, this is how you add path information for Minigw on Windows (still works in 10)...:
